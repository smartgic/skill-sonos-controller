## Installation

Make sure to be within the Mycroft `virtualenv` before running the `msm` command.

```shell
. mycroft-core/venv-activate.sh
msm install https://github.com/smartgic/mycroft-sonos-controller-skill.git
```

## Configuration

This skill utilizes the `settings.json` file which allows you to configure this skill via `home.mycroft.ai` after a few seconds of having the skill installed you should see something like below in the <https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill> location:

Fill this out with your appropriate information and hit the `save` button.

When Spotify music service is selected Mycroft will speak to you with a URL and code to follow. This URL is <https://sonos.smartgic.io/CODE> where `CODE` will be automatically and randomly generated by Mycroft and spoken to you *(e.g. Visit sonos.smartgic.io/FRK7Y)*.

<https://sonos.smartgic.io> is a URL shortener system which will temporary store the music service authentication URL. Once the authentication is done, the URL will be deleted from the URL shortener system.

This link will redirect you to the music service authentication login page using `https` protocol.
